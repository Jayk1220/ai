The Roman Empire was the most powerful and wide-ranging empire in human history, and was the foundation of Western civilization. In 27 B.C., Octavianus was crowned as the first emperor Augustus, and the republican Rome was converted into an established Rome. Rome ruled vast territories across Europe, North Africa, and West Asia based on its strong military power, elaborate administrative constitution, and dense road network. During the 'Pax Romana', which lasted for about 200 years, economy, art, architecture, and studies developed remarkably amid political stability.Latin later became the birthplace of many European languages and became the basis of Roman law. The technology and artistry of Rome are also demonstrated by grand structures such as the Colosseum and Pantheon. However, the empire gradually declined due to political corruption, economic difficulties, and external invasion, and after dividing into east and west in 395, the Western Roman Empire collapsed in 476. Nevertheless, the institutions, culture, and the spread of Christianity of the Roman Empire still have a profound impact on Western society to this day.
